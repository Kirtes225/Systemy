The Landkreuzer P. 1000 "Ratte" (English: Land Cruiser P. 1000 "Rat") was a design for a super-heavy tank for use by Nazi 
Germany during World War II, proposed by Krupp director Edward Grotte in June 1942, who had already named it "Landkreuzer". 
Submitted designs and drawings of the tank went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. 

The development history of the Ratte originated with a 1941 strategic study of Soviet heavy tanks conducted by Krupp, the
study also giving birth to the Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank. The study led to a suggestion from Krupp's director 
(Grotte), a special officer for submarine construction, who, on 23 June 1942, proposed to Hitler a 1,000-tonne tank which he 
named "Landkreuzer". It was to be armed with naval artillery and armored with 25 centimetres (10 in) of hardened steel, so 
heavy that only similar weapons could hope to affect it.

Hitler became enamored with Grotte's concept and ordered Krupp to begin development of it in 1942. As of December 29,
1942 a few preliminary drawings had been completed, by which time the concept had been named "Ratte" (Rat) by Hitler 
himself. These submitted designs went under the titles OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1. Albert Speer saw no 
reasonable use of the tank and canceled the project in 1943 before any prototype could be manufactured, although this did
lead to the concept of the Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster self-propelled siege gun, which would have been heavier than the 
Ratte. The general idea for such a big tank was best summed up by Heinz Guderian, saying that: "Hitler's fantasies 
sometimes shift into the gigantic".

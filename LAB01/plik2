The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 was a jet fighter aircraft developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB for the Soviet Union. 
The MiG-15 was one of the first successful jet fighters to incorporate swept wings to achieve high transonic speeds. 
In combat over Korea, it outclassed straight-winged jet day fighters which were largely relegated to ground attack roles, 
and was quickly countered by the similar American swept-wing F-86 Sabre. 
The MiG-15 is often mentioned, along with the North American F-86 Sabre, as the best fighter aircraft of the Korean
War, and among the best fighter aircraft of all time.

When refined into the more advanced MiG-17, the basic design would again surprise the West when it proved effective against
supersonic fighters such as the F-105 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in the Vietnam War of the 1960s.

The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the most widely produced jet aircraft ever made; in excess of 12,000 were
manufactured. Licensed foreign production may have raised the production total to over 18,000. The MiG-15 remains in
service with the North Korean Air Force as an advanced trainer.

Production
The USSR built around 12,000 MiG-15s in all variants. It was also built under license in Czechoslovakia (as the S-102 and S-103) and
Poland (as the Lim-1 and Lim-2, and two-seat SB Lim-1 and SB Lim-2).
